### LinkedIn Data - Analysis

**Objective:**
After being absent from Instagram for over a month, I've found myself spending more time on LinkedIn. While I am aware that this increased activity time is spent on networking and job applications, I recently stumbled upon a post detailing an individual's LinkedIn profile growth over the years. It created an interest in my mind, leading me to wonder about my own account usage. So, I ended up working on a Power BI project to analyze my LinkedIn profile data.

#### Note: Because the datasets contain personal information about my connections, I will not be uploading the data I used for this project. Instead, I will only be uploading a screenshot of the Power BI dashboard I created to share my observations.

**Results:**
The results have surprised me, clearly indicating that I haven't been as active on my account as I had believed. It's time for me to focus on enhancing my networking skills and submitting more job applications! ðŸ¥²

    <li>
      There is a steady growth in the number of linkedin connections - which makes sense as I started using it actively from 2022.
    </li>
    <li>
      While there're people from different domains in my network, it is surprising to me that I wasn't making more connections out of my university network. [Time to make some new friends and connections ðŸ˜…]
    </li>
    <li>
      It is very interesting to notice on the word-cloud that my network isn't diversified. All (95%) of my conenctions belong to only Tech Industry while I personally have diversified interests.

    <li>
      I guess I had decent amount of interactions with people so far on LinkedIn. But, I am definitely looking forward to connecting and interacting with more people.

  </ul>

  **Analysis:**
  While I always loved working on data, which most of the times was a general data. It's very interesting and fun to work on my personal data. It sort of helped me in understanding myself a little more. Identifying things that I never realized I was doing is the biggest take-away from this project which I know for sure would help me in many ways ðŸ’¯.
